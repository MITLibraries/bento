# Why does this module exist?
# 1) We display processing status information in our record page.
# 2) We can't just pass through that status information from Aleph, because
#    sometimes it is not patron-readable
# Therefore we need to be able to map what Aleph says to what we want to tell
# people.
#
# Additional wrinkles:
# 1) Some items have processing status codes (<z30-item-process-status-code>);
#    some do not.
# 2) The items in the <status> field are inconsistently spelled.
#
# In general, we want to use the processing status codes where available,
# because they have the cleanest data. So we have a mapping of status codes to
# our preferred display strings. However, when there isn't a status code, we
# also need a function for inferring it from the <status> field.
#
# Occasionally, we actually *do* want to use the <status> as provided by Aleph.
# (For instance, when the status is Claimed, the <status> is "Expected on
# $date"; as $date varies by item we can only get it by passing along the
# Aleph data.) In these cases, STATUS_MAP has nil for the code's value.
