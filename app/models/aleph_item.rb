# Checks Aleph for Realtime Status of Items
#
# == Required Environment Variables:
# - ALEPH_API_URI
# - ALEPH_KEY
#
# == Note
# - This interacts with an Aleph API Middleware and not directly with the
# Aleph API because Aleph natively only supports IP restriction which was
# not acceptable for this application's cloud based deployment intent.
# - The class is in need of a refactor which we are intentionally not doing at
# this time; see bottom of file for details.
# - We pass in `oclc` and `scan` not because we love it, but because it saves
# us from making two API calls to Aleph instead of one. This is a case of
# efficiency winning out over a preferred application design.
# - `scan` is set via `record_helper.rb`. You are welcome.

    # of <partial> will fail, leading to a bogus item in the availability

  # are sorted within the library and not as a whole. Naive sorting of strings
  # will cause an order such as v.1 v.10 v.2. This sorts by the numbers in the
  # description to provde a human expected sort order.
  # This sorts *first* by call number and *next* by library; this makes it
  # easier for people to look through large journal holdings.
  # Note that it swaps b <=>a for description but a<=>b for library. This lets
  # us display dates/volumes in DESCENDING order (on the theory that people are
  # most likely looking for more recent holdings), but libraries in ASCENDING
  # order (since this is how humans expect alphabetization to work).

# A note about refactoring:
#
# The AlephItem class should actually be two classes:
#   * AlephResponse
#     * Processes XML from the Aleph API
#     * May represent one or more actual library objects
#     * Has a function which returns an array of AlephObjects in lieu of the
#       current `items` function
#   * AlephObject
#     * Is instantiated by AlephResponse with data extracted from XML
#     * Represents exactly one library object
#     * Contains all the methods that currently take `item` as an argument -
#       those actually want to be methods of an AlephItem class and in many
#       cases want to be setting or using instance variables (e.g. `@title`)
#
# Originally this class was only needed for AlephResponse-type things; it grew
# a lot of AlephObject-type things to support the needs of the full record view.
#
# We discussed refactoring it at this time but chose not to because:
# 1) We believe we are nearing the end of our need to consume data from Aleph,
#    so the awkward developer UI will not slow us down as much as the refactor
#    would;
# 2) We may be moving to a new ILS in the near-ish term, which would render a
#    refactor moot.
#
# If we find ourselves needing to do substantial new work with this class after
# the close of DI-513, we may wish to reconsider the decision not to refactor.
#
# If we do refactor it will have implications for the following:
# * AlephItem tests
#   * Will need to be renamed and separated out into AlephResponse and
#     AlephObject tests
# * AlephHelper
#   * Some of its responsibiilities may more properly be methods on AlephObject
# * views/aleph/full_item_status.html.erb
#   * This file expects items to be key/value hashes; it will need to expect
#     instead to get AlephObjects and access their instance variables or methods
