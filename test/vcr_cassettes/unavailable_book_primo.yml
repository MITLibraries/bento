Using the empathetic medium of a poetry grounded in the sentient physical body we all share, he writes of a country endlessly at war--not only against so-called evildoers abroad but also with its own troubled conscience. Yet whether he is addressing the U.S. invasion of Iraq, the battle against the AIDS pandemic, or the \"culture wars\" surrounding the issues of feminism and gay marriage, Campo's compelling poems affirm the notion that from even the most bitter of conflicts arises hope. That hope--expressed here in the Cuban exile's dream of someday returning to his homeland, in a dying IV drug user's wish for humane medical treatment, in a downcast housewife's desire to express herself meaningfully through art--is that somehow we can be better than ourselves. Through a kaleidoscopic lens of poetic forms, Campo reveals this greatest of human aspirations as the one sustaining us all\"-- Publisher's description." ],

Using the empathetic medium of a poetry grounded in the sentient physical body we all share, he writes of a country endlessly at war--not only against so-called evildoers abroad but also with its own troubled conscience. Yet whether he is addressing the U.S. invasion of Iraq, the battle against the AIDS pandemic, or the \"culture wars\" surrounding the issues of feminism and gay marriage, Campo's compelling poems affirm the notion that from even the most bitter of conflicts arises hope. That hope--expressed here in the Cuban exile's dream of someday returning to his homeland, in a dying IV drug user's wish for humane medical treatment, in a downcast housewife's desire to express herself meaningfully through art--is that somehow we can be better than ourselves. Through a kaleidoscopic lens of poetic forms, Campo reveals this greatest of human aspirations as the one sustaining us all\"-- Publisher's description." ],

During the War for Independence, American revolutionaries held more than thirteen thousand prisoners--both British regulars and their so-called Hessian auxiliaries--in makeshift detention camps far from the fighting. As the Americans' principal site for incarcerating enemy prisoners of war, Lancaster stood at the nexus of two vastly different revolutionary worlds: one national, the other intensely local. Captives came under the control of local officials loosely supervised by state and national authorities. Concentrating the prisoners in the heart of their communities brought the revolutionaries' enemies to their doorstep, with residents now facing a daily war at home. Many prisoners openly defied their hosts, fleeing, plotting, and rebelling, often with the clandestine support of local loyalists. By early 1779, General George Washington, furious over the captives' ongoing attempts to subvert the American war effort, branded them \"dangerous guests in the bowels of our Country.\" The challenge of creating an autonomous national identity in the newly emerging United States was nowhere more evident than in Lancaster, where the establishment of a detention camp served as a flashpoint for new conflict in a community already unsettled by stark ethnic, linguistic, and religious differences. Many Lancaster residents soon sympathized with the Hessians detained in their town while the loyalist population considered the British detainees to be the true patriots of the war. Miller demonstrates that in Lancaster, the notably local character of the war reinforced not only preoccupations with internal security but also novel commitments to cause and country." ],

These Japanese Americans lost millions of dollars in property and were forced to live in so-called \"assembly centers\" surrounded by barbed wire fences and armed sentries. In this insightful and groundbreaking work, Brian Hayashi reevaluates the three-year ordeal of interred Japanese Americans. Using previously undiscovered documents, he examines the forces behind the U.S. government's decision to establish internment camps. His conclusion: the motives of government officials and top military brass likely transcended the standard explanations of racism, wartime hysteria, and leadership failure. Among the other surprising factors that played into the decision, Hayashi writes, were land development in the American West and plans for the American occupation of Japan. What was the long-term impact of America's actions? While many historians have explored that question, Hayashi takes a fresh look at how U.S. concentration camps affected not only their victims and American civil liberties, but also people living in locations as diverse as American Indian reservations and northeast Thailand." ],

                "abstract" : [ "Publisher's description: During World War II some 120,000 Japanese Americans were forcibly removed from their homes and detained in concentration camps in several states. These Japanese Americans lost millions of dollars in property and were forced to live in so-called \"assembly centers\" surrounded by barbed wire fences and armed sentries. In this insightful and groundbreaking work, Brian Hayashi reevaluates the three-year ordeal of interred Japanese Americans. Using previously undiscovered documents, he examines the forces behind the U.S. government's decision to establish internment camps. His conclusion: the motives of government officials and top military brass likely transcended the standard explanations of racism, wartime hysteria, and leadership failure. Among the other surprising factors that played into the decision, Hayashi writes, were land development in the American West and plans for the American occupation of Japan. What was the long-term impact of America's actions? While many historians have explored that question, Hayashi takes a fresh look at how U.S. concentration camps affected not only their victims and American civil liberties, but also people living in locations as diverse as American Indian reservations and northeast Thailand." ],
