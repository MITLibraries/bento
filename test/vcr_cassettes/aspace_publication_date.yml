        firm of Howe, Manning \u0026 Almy is believed to be the first architectural
        firm in Boston founded by women and the second in the United States. Lois
        Lilley Howe (Massachusetts Institute of Technology, SB 1890), whose commissions
        began in 1894, established her own firm in 1900 and asked Eleanor Manning
        (Massachusetts Institute of Technology, SB 1906), one of her draftsmen, to
        be her partner in 1913, creating the firm of Lois Lilley Howe \u0026 Manning.
        In 1926, another draftsman from the office, Mary Almy (Radcliffe College,
        1905, and Massachusetts Institute of Technology, SB 1922) became a partner,
        assuming responsibility for the business aspects of the firm. Manning focused
        on the technical architectural work and design problems, and Howe continued
        to concentrate on design. The firm dissolved in 1937 when Howe retired, and
        Manning and Almy started separate practices.\n\nThe emphasis of the firm was
        on domestic architecture and the partners did both building and remodeling.
        They were interested in urban housing problems and worked with the Architects''
        Small House Service Bureau of Massachusetts and the Boston Housing Association
        throughout the 1920s and 1930s. They submitted small house designs to the
        Department of the Interior for the Subsistence Homestead Communities, remodeled
        apartments for the Lynn Slum Clearance Project, and developed housing in Mariemont,
        Ohio. Materials of the firm include correspondence, financial data, reports,
        specifications, photographs, blueprints, drawings, and research materials
        that document the firm''s projects and commissions.\n\nThe collection also
        includes personal papers of the three architects including illustrated travel
        diaries, watercolors, sketchbooks, and architecural scrapbooks. Records from
        Eleanor Manning O''Connor''s  private architectural work after 1937 and material
        from the Seventeen Associated Architects are included. There are a number
        of documents about the Howe family in the personal papers of Lois Lilley Howe."],"contributors":[{"value":"Howe,
