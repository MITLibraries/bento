In a class of such models, like the generalized Sakai-Sugimoto model, baryons take the form of instantons of the effective flavor gauge theory that resides on probe flavor branes. In this paper we study the phase structure of baryonic crystals by analyzing discrete periodic configurations of such instantons. We find that instanton configurations exhibit a series of “popcorn” transitions upon increasing the density. Through these transitions normal (3D) lattices expand into the transverse dimension, eventually becoming a higher dimensional (4D) multi-layer lattice at large densities.We consider 3D lattices of zero size instantons as well as 1D periodic chains of finite size instantons, which serve as toy models of the full holographic systems. In particular, for the finite-size case we determine solutions of the corresponding ADHM equations for both a straight chain and for a 2D zigzag configuration where instantons pop up into the holographic dimension. At low density the system takes the form of an “abelian anti- ferromagnetic” straight periodic chain. Above a critical density there is a second order phase transition into a zigzag structure. An even higher density yields a rich phase space characterized by the formation of multi-layer zigzag structures. The finite size of the lattices in the transverse dimension is a signal of an emerging Fermi sea of quarks. We thus propose that the popcorn transitions indicate the onset of the “quarkyonic” phase of the cold dense nuclear matter." ],

As the simplest methyl‐bearing aldehyde, acetaldehyde constitutes a critical precursor to prebiotic molecules such as the sugar deoxyribose and amino acids via the Strecker synthesis. In this study, we reveal the first laboratory detection of 2,3‐butanedione (diacetyl, CH3COCOCH3) – a butter and popcorn flavorant – synthesized within acetaldehyde‐based interstellar analog ices exposed to ionizing radiation at 5 K. Detailed isotopic substitution experiments combined with tunable vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) photoionization of the subliming molecules demonstrate that 2,3‐butanedione is formed predominantly via the barrier‐less radical–radical reaction of two acetyl radicals (CH3ĊO). These processes are of fundamental importance for a detailed understanding of how complex organic molecules (COMs) are synthesized in deep space thus constraining the molecular structures and complexity of molecules forming in extraterrestrial ices containing acetaldehyde through a vigorous galactic cosmic ray driven non‐equilibrium chemistry.\nInterstellar popcorn: Exploiting photoionization reflectron time‐of‐flight mass spectrometry, we demonstrate that the popcorn and butter flavorant 2,3‐butanedione (diacetyl) represents the main reaction product of acetaldehyde ices exposed to ionizing radiation." ],

Inspired by a popcorn fabrication from corn raw, herein a unique porous macrocellular carbon composed of cross‐linked nano/microsheets by a powerful puffing of rice precursor is described. The rice is directly puffed with a volume enlargement of ≈20 times when it is instantaneously released from a sealed environment with a high pressure of 1.0 MPa at 200 °C. Interestingly, when metal (e.g., Ni) nanoparticles are embedded in the puffed rice derived carbon (PRC), high‐quality PRC/metal composites are achieved with attractive properties of a high electrical conductivity of ≈7.2 × 104 S m−1, a large porosity of 85.1%, and a surface area of 1492.2 m2 g−1. The PRC/Ni are employed as a host in lithium–sulfur batteries. The designed PRC/Ni/S electrode exhibits a high reversible capacity of 1257.2 mA h g−1 at 0.2 C, a prolonged cycle life (821 mA h g−1 after 500 cycles), and enhanced rate capability, much better than other counterparts (PRC/S and rGO/S). The excellent properties are attributed to the advantages of PRC/Ni network with a high electrical conductivity, strong adsorption/blocking ability for polysulfides, and interconnected porous framework.\nA unique porous microcellular carbon composed of cross‐linked nano/microsheets created by a powerful puffing of a rice precursor is described.

PFOA and PFOS not detected.•No PFAAs were found in corn and popcorn.\nAn analytical method is proposed to determine ten perfluorinated alkyl acids (PFAAs) [nine perfluorocarboxylic acids (PFCAs) and perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS)] in corn, popcorn and microwave popcorn packaging by focused ultrasound solid–liquid extraction (FUSLE) and ultra high performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC) coupled to quadrupole-time of flight mass spectrometry (QTOF-MS/MS). Selected PFAAs were extracted efficiently in only one 10-s cycle by FUSLE, a simple, safe and inexpensive technique. The developed method was validated for microwave popcorn bags matrix as well as corn and popcorn matrices in terms of linearity, matrix effect error, detection and quantification limits, repeatability and recovery values. The method showed good accuracy with recovery values around 100% except for the lowest chain length PFAAs, satisfactory reproducibility with RSDs under 16%, and sensitivity with limits of detection in the order of hundreds picograms per gram of sample (between 0.2 and 0.7ng/g). This method was also applied to the analysis of six microwave popcorn bags and the popcorn inside before and after cooking. PFCAs contents between 3.50ng/g and 750ng/g were found in bags, being PFHxA (perfluorohexanoic acid) the most abundant of them. However, no PFAAs were detected either corn or popcorn, therefore no migration was assumed." ],
