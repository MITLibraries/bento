In a class of such models, like the generalized Sakai-Sugimoto model, baryons take the form of instantons of the effective flavor gauge theory that resides on probe flavor branes. In this paper we study the phase structure of baryonic crystals by analyzing discrete periodic configurations of such instantons. We find that instanton configurations exhibit a series of “popcorn” transitions upon increasing the density. Through these transitions normal (3D) lattices expand into the transverse dimension, eventually becoming a higher dimensional (4D) multi-layer lattice at large densities.We consider 3D lattices of zero size instantons as well as 1D periodic chains of finite size instantons, which serve as toy models of the full holographic systems. In particular, for the finite-size case we determine solutions of the corresponding ADHM equations for both a straight chain and for a 2D zigzag configuration where instantons pop up into the holographic dimension. At low density the system takes the form of an “abelian anti- ferromagnetic” straight periodic chain. Above a critical density there is a second order phase transition into a zigzag structure. An even higher density yields a rich phase space characterized by the formation of multi-layer zigzag structures. The finite size of the lattices in the transverse dimension is a signal of an emerging Fermi sea of quarks. We thus propose that the popcorn transitions indicate the onset of the “quarkyonic” phase of the cold dense nuclear matter." ],

                "abstract" : [ "In the large N\nc\nlimit cold dense nuclear matter must be in a lattice phase. This applies also to holographic models of hadron physics. In a class of such models, like the generalized Sakai-Sugimoto model, baryons take the form of instantons of the effective flavor gauge theory that resides on probe flavor branes. In this paper we study the phase structure of baryonic crystals by analyzing discrete periodic configurations of such instantons. We find that instanton configurations exhibit a series of “popcorn” transitions upon increasing the density. Through these transitions normal (3D) lattices expand into the transverse dimension, eventually becoming a higher dimensional (4D) multi-layer lattice at large densities.We consider 3D lattices of zero size instantons as well as 1D periodic chains of finite size instantons, which serve as toy models of the full holographic systems. In particular, for the finite-size case we determine solutions of the corresponding ADHM equations for both a straight chain and for a 2D zigzag configuration where instantons pop up into the holographic dimension. At low density the system takes the form of an “abelian anti- ferromagnetic” straight periodic chain. Above a critical density there is a second order phase transition into a zigzag structure. An even higher density yields a rich phase space characterized by the formation of multi-layer zigzag structures. The finite size of the lattices in the transverse dimension is a signal of an emerging Fermi sea of quarks. We thus propose that the popcorn transitions indicate the onset of the “quarkyonic” phase of the cold dense nuclear matter." ],

Inspired by a popcorn fabrication from corn raw, herein a unique porous macrocellular carbon composed of cross‐linked nano/microsheets by a powerful puffing of rice precursor is described. The rice is directly puffed with a volume enlargement of ≈20 times when it is instantaneously released from a sealed environment with a high pressure of 1.0 MPa at 200 °C. Interestingly, when metal (e.g., Ni) nanoparticles are embedded in the puffed rice derived carbon (PRC), high‐quality PRC/metal composites are achieved with attractive properties of a high electrical conductivity of ≈7.2 × 104 S m−1, a large porosity of 85.1%, and a surface area of 1492.2 m2 g−1. The PRC/Ni are employed as a host in lithium–sulfur batteries. The designed PRC/Ni/S electrode exhibits a high reversible capacity of 1257.2 mA h g−1 at 0.2 C, a prolonged cycle life (821 mA h g−1 after 500 cycles), and enhanced rate capability, much better than other counterparts (PRC/S and rGO/S). The excellent properties are attributed to the advantages of PRC/Ni network with a high electrical conductivity, strong adsorption/blocking ability for polysulfides, and interconnected porous framework.\nA unique porous microcellular carbon composed of cross‐linked nano/microsheets created by a powerful puffing of a rice precursor is described.

The developed method was validated for microwave popcorn bags matrix as well as corn and popcorn matrices in terms of linearity, matrix effect error, detection and quantification limits, repeatability and recovery values. The method showed good accuracy with recovery values around 100% except for the lowest chain length PFAAs, satisfactory reproducibility with RSDs under 16%, and sensitivity with limits of detection in the order of hundreds picograms per gram of sample (between 0.2 and 0.7ng/g). This method was also applied to the analysis of six microwave popcorn bags and the popcorn inside before and after cooking. PFCAs contents between 3.50ng/g and 750ng/g were found in bags, being PFHxA (perfluorohexanoic acid) the most abundant of them.

We construct Skyrmionic multi-layered configurations such that the total Baryon charge is the product of the number of kinks along the radial AdS2 direction and the degree of the rational map. We show that, for fixed total Baryon charge, as one increases the charge density on ∂(AdS2×S2), it becomes increasingly convenient energetically to have configurations with more peaks in the radial AdS2 direction but a lower degree of the rational map. This has a direct relation with the so-called holographic popcorn transitions in which, when the charge density is high, multi-layered configurations with low charge on each layer are favored over configurations with few layers but with higher charge on each layer.

In spite of the rapid growth of alternative materials, platinum (Pt)-based or platinum alloy materials are still the most efficient catalysts for HER. Here, we report a hot-solvent synthesis for producing pop-corn shaped gallium-platinum (GaPt3) nanoparticles, which exhibits intermetallic behavior with abundant uneven surfaces that guarantee the extensive catalytic active edge sites. The electrochemical catalytic activity of GaPt3-based electrode towards HER was demonstrated for the first time, resulting an outstanding performance of only 27 mV overpotential to achieve the 10 mA/cm2 current density and a Tafel slope of 43.3 mV/dec. (vs. RHE) in acidic media, which is rather superior to that of commercial Pt catalysts and a relatively low overpotential (<80 mV) was obtained even operated at large area (5 cm2). Moreover, cycling tests for 10000-cycle CV sweep (−0.3 to 0.2 V vs. RHE) and durability test for 48 h were applied and the performance remains still, thus giving the confirmation to the long-lasting feature of GaPt3 nanoparticles.\nThe GaPt3 nanoparticles with pop-corn like appearance were prepared via hot-solvent synthesis for the first time, exhibit high-performance catalytic and long-lasting properties as HER electrodes.
