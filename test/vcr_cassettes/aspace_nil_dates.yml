        Society of Arts of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) was formed
        in 1862. It consisted of seventeen people who met to read the 1861 Act of
        Incorporation of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and enact the first
        by-laws of the Institute. The Society was to be one component of MIT, the
        others being a school and a museum. Between 1862 and 1865, however, the Society
        of Arts was the only element of Massachusetts Institute of Technology extant.
        Meetings consisted of discussions of Institute business followed by a lecture
        on a scientific or technical topic. After the school opened in 1865, and the
        Society was no longer responsible for governing the Institute, its meetings
        focused on lectures on a wide range of subjects and demonstrations of inventions.
        Records in the collection include the minutes of meetings of the Society,
        which include the reports of the Executive Committee and officers, and abstracts
        or transcripts of lectures, demonstrations, and exhibits presented before
        the Society."],"contributors":[{"value":"Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
