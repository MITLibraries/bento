To the best of author’s knowledge, this is the first attempt to develop a version of SMO which can solve constrained continuous optimization problems by using the Deb’s technique for handling constraints. The proposed algorithm is named constrained spider monkey optimization (CSMO) algorithm. The performance of CSMO is investigated on the well-defined constrained optimization problems of CEC2006 and CEC2010 benchmark sets. The results of the proposed algorithm are compared with constrained versions of particle swarm optimization, artificial bee colony and differential evolution. Outcome of the experiment and the discussion of results demonstrate that CSMO handles the global optimization task very well for constrained optimization problems and shows better performance in comparison with compared algorithms. Such an outcome will be an encouragement for the research community to further explore the potential of SMO in solving benchmarks as well as real-world problems, which are often constrained in nature." ],

The proposed algorithm is named constrained spider monkey optimization (CSMO) algorithm. The performance of CSMO is investigated on the well-defined constrained optimization problems of CEC2006 and CEC2010 benchmark sets. The results of the proposed algorithm are compared with constrained versions of particle swarm optimization, artificial bee colony and differential evolution. Outcome of the experiment and the discussion of results demonstrate that CSMO handles the global optimization task very well for constrained optimization problems and shows better performance in comparison with compared algorithms.

The purpose of this article is to study the performance of SMO after incorporating quadratic approximation (QA) operator in it. The proposed version is named as QA‐based spider monkey optimization (QASMO). An experimental study has been carried out to check the validity and applicability of QASMO. For validation purpose, the performance of QASMO is tested over a benchmark set of 46 scalable and nonscalable problems, and results are compared with the original SMO algorithm. In order to test the applicability of the proposed algorithm in solving real‐life optimization problems, one of the most challenging optimization problems, namely, Lennard–Jones (LJ) problem is considered. LJ clusters containing atoms from three to ten have been taken into consideration, and results are presented. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to apply SMO and its proposed variant on a real‐life problem. The results demonstrate that incorporation of QA in SMO has positive effects on its performance in terms of reliability, efficiency, and accuracy." ],

The purpose of this article is to study the performance of SMO after incorporating quadratic approximation (QA) operator in it. The proposed version is named as QA‐based spider monkey optimization (QASMO). An experimental study has been carried out to check the validity and applicability of QASMO. For validation purpose, the performance of QASMO is tested over a benchmark set of 46 scalable and nonscalable problems, and results are compared with the original SMO algorithm. In order to test the applicability of the proposed algorithm in solving real‐life optimization problems, one of the most challenging optimization problems, namely, Lennard–Jones (LJ) problem is considered. LJ clusters containing atoms from three to ten have been taken into consideration, and results are presented. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to apply SMO and its proposed variant on a real‐life problem. The results demonstrate that incorporation of QA in SMO has positive effects on its performance in terms of reliability, efficiency, and accuracy." ]

First is the assignment of PCB, second is the assignment of machines, the last is the component assignment problem. In this research, the SMO algorithm is applied on optimization of component assignment which is divided into two stages: local leader phase (LLP) and global leader phase (GLP). In the first stage, the electronic components are assigned to the feeders by GLP. In the second stage, the component placement sequence, which is apparently known as a travelling salesman problem (TSP), is determined by LLP. Numerical experiments are performed to compare the performance of SMO algorithm with others under various experimental settings, the results show that the proposed method is more effective than other traditional methods. A production model is created with the proposed method, which is calimed to be able to increase the efficiency of the product services." ],
